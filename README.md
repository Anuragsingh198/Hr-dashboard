# Mini HR Performance Dashboard

A modern web application designed to assist HR managers in efficiently tracking and managing employee performance. Built with React and Next.js, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of employee data with performance metrics.

## Key Features

### 1. Dashboard Homepage (`/`)
- Fetches employee data from 
`dummyjson.com/users?limit=20`
- Enriches data with mock department and performance ratings using randomized logic
- Displays employee cards showing:
  - Full name, email, age, and department
  - Star rating component (1-5 stars)
  - Action buttons (View, Bookmark, Promote)
- Implementation:
  - Uses React hooks for data fetching
  - Handles loading and error states
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 2. Search & Filter Functionality
**Search Bar:**
- Searches employees by name, email, or department
- Case-insensitive matching
- Real-time filtering as user types

**Multi-select Filters:**
- Filter by department
- Combine with search for precise results

**Implementation Details:**
- Controlled React state for search input
- Custom 
`useSearch`
 hook encapsulates filtering logic
- Debounced search input for performance
- Combined filter function checks multiple criteria:
  - Name/email/department matches search text
  - Department matches selected filters

### 3. Bookmark Manager (`/bookmarks`)
- Displays all bookmarked employees in card layout
- Features:
  - "Remove Bookmark" button to delete bookmarks
  - "Promote" button (UI-only action)
  
**State Management:**
- Uses Context API for global state
- Bookmarks persist across pages
- Instant UI updates on changes

### 4. Analytics Page (`/analytics`)
- Visualizes employee performance data using Chart.js
- Charts include:
  - Department-wise average ratings (bar/pie chart)
  - Bookmark trends (line/bar chart with mocked data)

**Data Processing:**
- Frontend aggregation of performance ratings
- Calculates averages by department
- Groups bookmark data for visualization

**Implementation:**
- React Chart.js wrappers for integration
- Responsive charts adapt to screen size
- Supports both light/dark modes
- Shows loading states during processing
